# Ng_JustineNathalie_HW2_CrushingBugs
The goal of this project is to fix the bugs and make the user experience more interactive. It’s a simple drag-and-drop activity where you match labels to the correct parts of the human body, built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The original version had a couple of issues. Bug A let you drop more than one label into the same spot, which wasn’t supposed to happen. Bug B was the reset button not working, the labels didn’t go back to where they started.

I fixed both bugs and added some basic effects to make the user experience a bit more fun and interactive.  (A written explanation is attached on how I fixed the bugs and added the effects.)

You can drag the labels onto the body parts to match them.
Hovering over a drop zone highlights it, and clicking the reset button will bring everything back to the start.
Open the browser console to see any logs during drag and drop.
